## Features

### Ordering by _Any_ (numeric) Property

Each Timeline View orders your notes based on a property of your choice, which defaults to the creation time. You can open multiple views, each with its own selected property.

The plugin detects all properties within your vault and lists any numeric (date, datetime, or number) properties as available options. Once a property is selected, the notes automatically rearrange, and the timeline adapts to the appropriate measurement.

![Available properties](docs/resources/available-properties.PNG)

When a property is selected, the notes will automatically be re-arranged, and the appropriate type of measurement will appear at the top of the timeline.

### ‚ú® Quick Note Creation

Double-click anywhere on the timeline to instantly create a new note. The property value for this note will be automatically set based on where you clicked on the timeline.

### üìå Drag & Drop Reordering

Easily update the property value of a note by dragging and dropping it on the timeline.

- Move a single note:

    ![drag and drop single note](docs/resources/move-single-note-example.gif)

- Or move a selection of notes to change their values together.

### üîç Filter

Want to focus only on relevant notes? Apply a filter to your timeline using a query that (mostly) follows Obsidian's search syntax. For details on syntax limitations, see [Obsidian Search](https://github.com/b-camphart/obsidian-search).

![Filter Property](docs/resources/filter-property.PNG)

The filtered view renames the tab to match the provided filter, making it easy to differentiate between multiple open timeline tabs.

You can also set a default filter in the plugin settings to apply to every new timeline you open.

### üé® Group Notes with Colors

Use the same query syntax as filtering to group notes by color, similar to Obsidian's graph view. This makes it easy to visually distinguish different groups of notes on your timeline.

### üîó Link to Tab

Open the timeline as a "linked view" from within an existing tab, or link it to another tab after opening. Once linked, navigating to a new note automatically focuses and scrolls the timeline to that note.

Additionally, clicking on a note in the linked timeline will open it in the linked tab.
